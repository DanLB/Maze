** Include ServiceLocator.h anywhere the sound is to be played **

To Use:
	ServiceLocator::GetAudio()->_______() //Function to whatever you want in soundprovider

** Include SFMLSoundProvider.h and ServiceLocator.h to initialize the Service Locator

To Initialize (in game)
	SFMLSoundProvider soundProvider
	ServiceLocator::RegisterServiceLocator(&soundProvider)
